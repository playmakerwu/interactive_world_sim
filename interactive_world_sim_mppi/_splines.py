DO NOT modify the algorithmic content of this file. If diffusion-forcing
is updated upstream and we want the new behavior, re-copy rather than
editing in place. The bitwise equivalence test in
scripts/smoke_bitwise_equivalence.py guards against accidental drift.

    """Compute cubic splines

    Compute the second-derivatives (M) for a natural cubic spline in D dimensions,

    The only loop is over the knot index K for the Thomas algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : torch.Tensor
        A (B, K, D) tensor of data points, where:
          B = batch size (number of spline problems),

    Returns
    -------
    M : torch.Tensor
        A (B, K, D) tensor of second derivatives for each batch and dimension.
